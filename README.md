# t2pks_module
Source of the new anstiSMASH module for type II PKS gene cluster analysis which will be included in the new release coming in December 2018.

The source code is not executable without being integrated with the antiSMASH source code. It has recently been added to the actual antiSMASH 5.0 source code with tweaks, see https://github.com/antismash/antismash/tree/master/antismash/modules/t2pks
